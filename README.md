# repo

Repo is a tool built on top of Git.  Repo helps manage many Git repositories,
does the uploads to revision control systems, and automates parts of the
development workflow.  Repo is not meant to replace Git, only to make it
easier to work with Git.  The repo command is an executable Python script
that you can put anywhere in your path.

This is a fork from GerritCodeReview/git-repo, However we may not using gerrit for code review.
There are some of the developers using gitlab for code review, repo is quite flexible and easy used for gitlab as well.

This is only demo changes for gitlab or other non-gerrit codereview platform.
